# Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge (Vehicles Example)

class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        pass  # Abstract behavior to be defined in subclasses

class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Driving 🚗")

class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Flying ✈️")

class Boat(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Sailing ⛵")

# Using polymorphism
vehicles = [Car(), Plane(), Boat()]

for v in vehicles:
    v.move()  # Each move() behaves differently depending on the class
