 OOP Assignment - Superhero & Polymorphism Challenge
ðŸ“š Description
This project is part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment. It contains two activities:

âœ… Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
Created a class called Superhero with attributes and methods.
Implemented encapsulation using private attributes.
Used constructors to initialize each object.
Added inheritance to create subclasses like FlyingHero and StrongHero.
Demonstrated polymorphism by overriding methods in the child classes.
ðŸŽ­ Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
Implemented a base class Vehicle with a method move().
Created multiple subclasses (Car, Plane, Boat) that override the move() method.
Demonstrated polymorphism through a loop calling the same method on different objects.
